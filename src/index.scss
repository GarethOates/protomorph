// This view has one parent and two children, Child1 and Child2 in the components folder.
// This is a demonstration that by simply including this one component in the js, we pull
// into the build all the style dependencies, but only include any shared dependencies once.

// NOTE: I am not importing the components scss files in here.
// The only code we need here are tweaks for the view.
